ERROR! 'run_once_per_host' is not a valid attribute for a Task

The error appears to have been in '/home/rdeva/serverdetection.yml': line 181, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Add server details to physical servers list
      ^ here

This error can be suppressed as a warning using the "invalid_task_attribute_failed" configuration
